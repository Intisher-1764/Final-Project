utomatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser
CS 207
This is an Arduino base project called Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser. It is a touchless Hand Sanitizer Dispenser that detects when someone puts his/her hand and serves sanitizer to hand.
Due to the Covid-19 we all are facing a lot of trouble in our day-to-day life. Sanitizing hand in one of the best precaution people can take to keep themselves safe from Covid-19. In this case a touchless Hand Sanitizer Dispenser will help a lot. As we know corona virus is very contagious. If everyone uses the same Hand Sanitizer Dispenser and touch it with their hands, there is always a possible risk to get infected by that .So, touchless Hand Sanitizer Dispenser is the best solution in this case.
The main project from which I have been inspired from is made by Akshay Joseph on create.arduino.cc.I have modified a few this to make it more functionality, like adding two motors instead of one and adding a buzzer in the system.
The following materials are required: -Arduino UNO -Ultrasonic sensor -Servo motor -Hand Sanitizer Bottle-Piezo buzzer -Jumper wires.

Here is the link of the website from which this project has been inspired from.
